                <p> UASU-TUM Chapter is a branch of a registered trade union representing teaching staff working for the Technical University of Mombasa. The chapter enjoys a legal status as it was registered on 14 September 2010 under the Labor Relations Act as UASU-MPUC branch. It was issued with Certificate of Registration No. TU/143. The chapter started with 94 members and the first union dues were deducted in October 2010. It was the first small chapter to join the UASU fraternity at that time comprising of seven universities namely: University of Nairobi, Kenyatta University, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Egerton University, Maseno University, Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology, and Moi University. </p><br>


                <p>After consultations between the chapter officials and the then principal, MPUC implemented the national 2008-2010 CBA in full. In its nascent days, the then principal extended financial assistance to the chapter by giving free transport and paying per diem without for travelling officials attending meetings upcountry national delegates’ conference.Apart from support by Prof. Mwatela, the then national office also extended its support by visiting the chapter. After The chapter chairman and chapter secretary were also invited by the national office to attend a series of national negotiations held between 18 November 2009 and 21 December 2009 at the Merica Hotel in Nakuru.</p><br>

                <p>These meetings imparted invaluable negotiation skills in these two officials.
The reasoning behind starting the chapter was that academic staff are intellectual workers who sell their services for a price. Therefore, they need to negotiate some of the terms under which they are hired including workload, various allowances, and medical and retirement benefits.It is a known fact that any group of workers who are not organized always end up getting a raw deal. </p><br><p>
The UASU- MPUC Chapter was launched on 30 October 2009. The then principal of the university college, Prof. Josephat Mwatela played an important part in ensuring that the chapter was established and that it operated independently of its mother university chapter, UASU-JKUAT Chapter. He promised to invite officials from the JKUAT chapter and indeed, he lived up to his word. The person sent from JKUAT to establish the chapter was one Mathew Winja, their chapter organizing secretary.</p><br>
<p>

Winja was a visiting part-time lecturer teaching in building and civil engineering department of MPUC and a classmate of our former colleague, Julius Got, who was also in the same department. Winja landed in MPUC and after paying a courtesy call on Prof. Mwatela, he sought out Got and together, embarked on an office-to-office search for potential volunteers to take up the onerous task of becoming interim officials of the chapter. Some individuals accepted while others turned down the request. At this point, none of those who accepted knew which position they would occupy. Once he got ten volunteers ready to spearhead the launch of the chapter, Winja asked these individuals to assemble at the Holiday Stadium Inn at 6 p.m. the same evening. It is at this meeting that the volunteers were asked to name the position they would be comfortable with and each person did so.
</p>
<p> Thus, the <b>first interim officials of the chapter </b>were found.</p><br>
They included:
<ol>
<li>Joseph Ngare – Chapter Chairman.</li>
<li>	Njeru Gatumu – Chapter Secretary.</li>
<li>	Dr. Oloo Otieno – Chapter Treasurer.</li>
<li>	Julius Got – Chapter Organizing Secretary.</li>
<li>	Rama Suleiman (late) – Chapter Vice-Chairman</li>
<li>	Dr. June Mwajuma- Chapter Deputy Secretary.</li>
<li>	Judith Alusa – Chapter Assistant Treasurer</li>
<li>	Arif Khamis – Chapter Trustee</li>
<li>	Joseph Dzuya – Chapter Trustee</li>
<li>	Mativo Kioko – Chapter Trustee.</li></ol>
<p>
The interim officials served for only six months from October 2009 to February 2010. Since trade union elections were due nationally for all unions operating in Kenya, they had to seek the mandate of the members for them to be substantive officials. The UASU-MPUC Chapter held its first elections on 17 February 2010 at the Kiziwi Conference Hall. The following officials got the mandate of the members:</p>


<ol><li>	Joseph Ngare – Chapter Chairman.</li>
<li>	Njeru Gatumu – Chapter Secretary.</li>
<li>	Dr. Oloo Otieno – Chapter Treasurer.</li>
<li>	Julius Got – Chapter Organizing Secretary.</li>
<li>	Stephen Wachira – Chapter Vice-Chairman.</li>
<li>	Dr. June Mwajuma – Chapter Deputy Secretary.</li>
<li>	Judith Alusa – Chapter Assistant Treasurer.</li>
<li>	Dr. Mgala Mvurya – Chapter Trustee.</li>
<li>	Joseph Dzuya – Chapter Trustee.</li>
<li>Dr. Jean Mzera Uzel – Chapter Trustee.</li></ol>
<b>The second chapter elections</b> were held on 11 March 2016 at the Engineering Block. By this time, the university had changed from a university college to a substantive university by the name Technical University of Mombasa. To this extent, the chapter name had morphed to UASU-TUM Chapter. The officials elected on this day included:
<ol><li>Joseph Ngare – Chapter Chairman.</li>
<li>	Njeru Gatumu – Chapter Secretary.</li>
<li>Dr. Oloo Otieno – Chapter Treasurer.</li>
<li>	Juma Kamanza – Chapter Organizing Secretary.</li>
<li>	John Wambua – Chapter Vice-Chairman.</li>
<li>	Dr. June Mwajuma – Chapter Deputy Secretary.</li>
<li>	Dr. Faith Ongachi- Chapter Assistant Treasurer.</li>
<li>Dr. Kennedy Hadullo – Chapter Trustee.</li>
<li>	Rophus Mwakideu – Chapter Trustee.</li>
<li>Dr. Patrick Korir – chapter Trustee.</li></ol>
<b>The third chapter elections </b>were held on 18 March 2021 at the marine Engineering Block. The following officials were elected to steer the chapter for the next five years:
<ol><li>	Dr. Oloo Otieno – chapter Chairman.</li>
<li>	Prof. Josiah Odalo – chapter Secretary.</li>
<li>Hassan Shee – Chapter Treasurer.</li>
<li>	Dr. Kennedy Hadullo – Chapter Organizing Secretary.</li>

<li>Vincent Oyoti – Chapter Assistant Treasurer.</li>
<li>	Dr. Aggrey Adem – Chapter Trustee.</li>
<li>	David Malombe – Chapter Trustee.</li>
<li>Judy Rop – Chapter Trustee.</li></ol>
<P>The new team is expected to build on the great work put in by their predecessors for the betterment of the terms and conditions of service of the academic staff of the Technical University of Mombasa in addition to jealously protecting their rights.
Milestones In the past, the chapter had scored firsts among the many chapters of the public universities in Kenya.

<P> These include, inter alia:</P>

<P>1.	UASU-TUM Chapter took the university to court over a dispute relating to TUM management’s quest to increase workload form 3 units to 4 for those teaching degree and 4 to 5 for those teaching diploma programs respectively. In petition No. 6 of 2019, Justice Linnet Ndolo of the Employment and Labor Relations Court, Mombasa delivered judgment that TUM’s new academic policy requiring members to teach 4 units instead of 3 per semester is suspended pending further orders of the court.
In the subsequent appeal lodged by TUM in Civil Appeal No. 146 of 2019 between Technical University of Mombasa and UASU-TUM Chapter, Justices W. Ouko, D.K. Musinga, S. Gatembu Kairo of Court of Appeal in a judgment delivered on 19 may 2021, ruled that TUM’s appeal failed and is dismissed with costs.
Other chapters like UASU-Maseno Chapter, UASU-Masai Mara Chapter have since sought the assistance of UASU-TUM Chapter form guidance on how to legally challenge the imposition of additional workloads in their universities.
</P>
<P>2.	UASU-TUM Chapter was the first trade union to successfully challenge through writing the SRC and make it change its advisory. In an advisory to Prof. Laila Abubakar dated 4 September 2017, SRC stated that the internal 2013-2017 CBA should be negotiated with a view to retaining the existing rates on all items with financial implications. The chapter responded by writing to the SRC a letter dated 18 September 2017 which raised four pertinent points. To her credit, the VC wrote a covering letter to accompany the union’s letter. The SRC replied in a letter dated 31 October 2017 that its mandate was to advise employing agencies and not unions. They stuck to their guns but the union relentlessly pursued the matter both formally through the VC and informally through its networks in Nairobi. Ultimately, SRC gave in and members got an internal CBA with enhanced financial benefits. No other trade union in Kenya has been able to achieve this feat.
</P>
<P>3.	In the 2010-2012/2013 internal CBA, the chapter rejected the machinations of the management to minimize the enhancement of commuter allowance by paying 6,000/- to those using public means and 12,000/- to those using private cars. The officials held out for one year and were able to convince the council to pay 13,000/- for those using private cars and 6,500/- to those using public means. With this success, all the other non-teaching staff in TUM got their commuter allowance enhanced to the level paid to academic staff.
Road Ahead

<P>It is never easy extracting concessions from any management in an organization. The same is true of TUM management. Most of the individuals who advise the top managers and with whom the union negotiates with belong to a sister union and due to sibling rivalry, are usually inclined to ensure that the academic staff do not gain without any corresponding benefit to them. This is a major stumbling block in the union’s endeavor to better the terms and conditions of service for its members. The financial challenges that all the public universities, including TUM are facing is yet another challenge arising from underfunding of the public universities compounded by home-grown initiatives to generate income. The road ahead promises to be bumpy. However, as a union, we will strive to do our best to extract maximum benefits possible for our members. We ask for your continued support. Together, we shall achieve!
